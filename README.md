## 2. Plant Inventory Management (Admin)

- Add New Plants: Input details like name, flower color, lifespan, plant type, bloom time, height, leaf type, and price.

- Update Plant Details: Modify specific attributes such as price or bloom time.

- Delete Plants: Remove plants from the inventory.

- View Available Plants: Display all plants in a structured table format.

## 3. Order Processing (Customer)

- Place Orders: Select plants, specify quantity, and confirm payment mode.

- Generate Unique Transaction IDs for order tracking.

- Automatic ID Assignment for seamless order management.

- Order Data Logging in a MySQL database and CSV file.

## 4. Data Storage & Logging

- MySQL Database Integration:

  - plants table stores plant details.

  - users table manages user accounts.

  - orders table logs customer purchases.

- CSV & Binary File Logging:

  - users.csv stores registered users.

  - plants.csv maintains plant inventory.

  - orders.csv logs all customer purchases.

  - activity_log.bin records system actions.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python

- Database: MySQL

- Libraries:

  - mysql-connector-python (MySQL connectivity)

  - tabulate (Formatted table display)

  - csv (Data export)

  - pickle (Binary file logging)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed:

  - Python 3.10+

  - MySQL Server & MySQL Workbench

  - Required Python libraries:

      #### pip install mysql-connector-python tabulate

### Database Setup

#### 1. Create the database:

CREATE DATABASE plantstore;
USE plantstore;

#### 2. Create tables:

CREATE TABLE plants (
  Plant_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  Plant_Name VARCHAR(50),
  Flower_Color VARCHAR(50),
  Lifespan VARCHAR(50),
  Plant_Type VARCHAR(50),
  Bloom_Time VARCHAR(50),
  Avg_Plant_Height_cm INT,
  Leaf_Type VARCHAR(50),
  Price_INR INT
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'customer'
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  transaction_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  pay_mode ENUM('Cash', 'Credit Card', 'Debit Card', 'Online') NOT NULL,
  address TEXT NOT NULL,
  order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES users(username)
);

## Running the Application

#### 1. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/khanfaraz334/plant-management-system](https://github.com/khanfaraz334/SQL-PYTHON-PROJECT).git
cd SQL-PYTHON-PROJECT

#### 2. Run the script:

python FINAL_CS_PROJECT.py

## Usage

## User Flow

1. New users must sign up before logging in.

2. Admins can manage plant data, while customers can browse plants and place orders.
